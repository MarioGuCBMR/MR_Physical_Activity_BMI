# OBTAINING RAW DATA FOR CAUSE AND 2SMR ANALYSIS

In the code you will find "~/RAW_DATA" which you need to replace with the path leading to this folder, which you need to fill with the following data to be able to reproduce the analysis for this publication.

### Physical activity and inactivity traits

For physical activity we decided to use accelerometer data for vigorous physical activity, moderate physical activity and sedentary time from two different sources.

Vigorous physical activity from the acc425 model from Klimentidis et al 2018 available here: (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p2-aKT6GgOv4425yaIcvO0nN30O4mpPh).

Moderate physical activity form Doherty et al available here: (https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ff479f44-bf35-48b9-9e67-e690a2937b22/download_file?file_format=gzip&safe_filename=Doherty-2018-NatureComms-moderate.csv.gz&type_of_work=Dataset).

And sedentary time from Doherty et al available here: (https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ff479f44-bf35-48b9-9e67-e690a2937b22/download_file?file_format=gzip&safe_filename=Doherty-2018-NatureComms-sedentary.csv.gz&type_of_work=Dataset).

### Anthropometric traits:

As explained before, the main analysis are for BMI as the main adiposity trait, though we also ran analysis for other traits that inform about central obesity or abdominal fat accumualation: body fat percentage, waist circumference adjusted for BMI and waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for BMI.
