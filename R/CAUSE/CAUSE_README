#REAME for reproducing CAUSE analysis.

#Since this is a bidirectional MR publication, the amount of combinations of traits is quite big. 

Furthermore, the traits are not from the same consortium and each type of data requires different QCs.For this reason, I decided to generate a code that goes through each combination
#of traits step by step, without assuming that all of them possess all rsIDs, for example.

#1) QC
#2) data merging,
#3) clumping
#4) CAUSE's main analysis
