The code in this folder can:

1) re-run CAUSE cause() functions with the input data for a specific combination of traits.
2) Or just prints CAUSE's results.

To re-run CAUSE for a specific combination of traits, you need:

1) A dataframe obtained by merging the data (X)
2) the parameters obtained by est_params() functions using the X dataframe.
3) the pruned variants for each exposure trait.

Finally, cause() is run with alpha = 1 and beta = 2.
